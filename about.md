### More Information

I love building things. I have built skyscrapers, parking garages, houses, children and now websites, software and games. Teaching myself web development on a busy schedule has been extremely difficult, but so rewarding and fun. I want o help beginners and intermediates alike get started, and more importantly stick with programming and design by highlighting some of my greatest failures and how to avoid them.
